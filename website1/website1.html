So this is a paragraph.
Ok.
So a paragraph is like a chunk of words right?
I can write as many things as I want.
Cool.
<br>
So all the things above are in one line.
<br>
I didn't expect that.
<br>
Computers are really <b>stupid</b>.
<br>
They only do what you tell them to do.
So if you don't tell them to start a new line they won't.
<br>
Ok.
<br>
<br>
<br>
What is a list?
Let me try.
<br>
</p>

<ul>1,2,3,4</ul>
<ul>1 2 3 4
<br>
a b c d e
<br>

</ul>

<ul>11</ul> <ul>12</ul>
<ul>21</ul> <ul>22</ul>

<ul>11 12 13</ul>
